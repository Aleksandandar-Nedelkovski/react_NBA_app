# React NBA app

• Created a Single Page App using React to deliver news, articles, videos about NBA.
• Utilized modern JavaScript to fetch JSON data from Firebase and render it in the app.
• Used Redux to manage state as the app grows. This resulted in 50% faster loading times for my data-heavy app.
• Utilized Test-Driven Development with integration tests using  Jest and Enzyme.

Deployed app on Heroku: https://react-nba-app.herokuapp.com/
