# React NBA app

<ul>
<li>Created a Single Page App using React to deliver news, articles, videos about NBA.</li>
<li>Utilized modern JavaScript to fetch JSON data from Firebase and render it in the app.</li>
<li>Used Redux to manage state as the app grows. This resulted in 50% faster loading times for my data-heavy app.</li>
<li>Utilized Test-Driven Development with integration tests using  Jest and Enzyme.</li>
</ul>

Deployed app on Heroku: https://react-nba-app.herokuapp.com/
